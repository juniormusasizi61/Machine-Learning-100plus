**project introduction** 
This article aims to implement a robust *machine-learning* model that can efficiently predict the disease of a human, based on the symptoms that he/she possesses. Let us look into how we can approach this machine-learning problem:

This project is based on *[G4G](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning/)* which can be accessed for more information and more knowledge about the concept.
We shall follow this approach in this project
- Gathering the data
- cleaning the data using ['label encoder'](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-label-encoding-of-datasets-in-python/) for  numerical data columns
- Model building
- Ineference
